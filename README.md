# MYOB Coding Challenge - README

This repository holds my solution to the MYOB Coding Challenge. In this challenge, I have used the Ruby language to implement a console-based versioon of Tic Tac Toe that allows two humans to play a game on a 3 x 3 board.

## Setup Instructions

```

Move into the project folder by entering the following terminal command:
